## Introduction

**nf-core/references** is a bioinformatics pipeline that build references.

This repo contains references yaml files that describe references.

These references yaml files can either be used to build references using the [nf-core/references](https://github.com/nf-core/references) pipeline, or to be used as a reference in an nf-core pipeline.

The [igenomes_source/](https://github.com/nf-core/references-assets/tree/main/igenomes_source) folder will contain references yaml files that are source references yaml files used to generate/update references that will be stored in AWS iGenomes as currently described in the [igenomes/](https://github.com/nf-core/references-assets/tree/main/igenomes) folder.

The [igenomes/](https://github.com/nf-core/references-assets/tree/main/igenomes) folder contains references yaml files that describe what is currently available in AWS iGenomes, plus any meta data.
These files can be used to start a pipeline, when using the corresponding schema with an up to date pipeline.
They are initially generated by the [generate_yaml_asset.sh](https://github.com/nf-core/references-assets/blob/main/bin/generate_yaml_asset.sh) script.

The [igenomes_no_base/](https://github.com/nf-core/references-assets/tree/main/igenomes_no_base) folder contains references yaml files that have the same information as described before, but without the igenomes_base params.

The [genomes_source/](https://github.com/nf-core/references-assets/tree/main/genomes_source) folder contains references yaml files that are source references yaml files, that will be used later on to generate/update genomes in AWS iGenomes.

The [genomes/](https://github.com/nf-core/references-assets/tree/main/genomes) folder contains references yaml files that describe what is currently available `s3://nf-core-references`, plus any meta data.
These files can be used to start a pipeline, when using the corresponding schema with an up to date pipeline.

The [genomes_no_base/](https://github.com/nf-core/references-assets/tree/main/genomes_no_base) folder contains references yaml files that have the same information as described before, but without the igenomes_base params.

## Usage

To use a references yaml file in an nf-core pipeline, a link toward the raw reference yaml file can be used.
Either using the `main` branch, or a specific commit for versioning and reproducibility purposes.
